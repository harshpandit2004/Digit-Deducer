# Digit Deducer

This repository contains the code for my second React Native project, called "Digit Deducer". It is a simple application that asks the user for a number. The program then generates a random number and displays it to the user. The user responds by indicating whether the computer should guess a higher number, a lower number, or if it matches their original input.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for my second React Native project, "Digit Deducer", developed while following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course "React Native - The Practical Guide 2023". The project is a simple application that asks the user for a number. It then generates a random number and displays it to the user. The user can respond by indicating whether the computer should guess a higher number, a lower number, or if it matches their original input.

The purpose of this project is to practice working with user input, random number generation, and conditional logic in React Native. By following along with the course, I gained hands-on experience in building a functional and interactive guessing game.

Please note that the project structure and code implementation may vary slightly based on personal modifications and the progression of the course lessons.
